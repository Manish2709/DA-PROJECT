# DA-PROJECT
The repository for our Data Analytics Project

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
We have done a simple project on predicting whether the income of a citizen exceeds $50000 or not based on different features such as age, educcation, etc.

# DATASET USED
We have used Barry Becker's 1994 Census dataset for our project, it is found in the UCI Machine Learning repository

# MODELS USED
We have used the three models to compare the results between each other
  1) KNN
  2) Naive Bayes
  3) Decison Tree

# SOURCE CODE
There are two files in this repository
  1) EDA.ipynb -  A jupyter notebook which contains all the EDA that we have done
  2) DA-models.ipynb - A jupyter notebook which contains all the models implemented

# STEPS TO RUN THE PROJECT
  1) Install Anaconda in your local system
  2) Open Jupyter Notebooks
  3) Select the required notebooks and ensure the following packages are installed
      a)NumPy
      b)Pandas
      c)Scikit-learn
      d)Matplotlib
      e)seaborn
      f)Graphviz
      g)os
      h)requests
      i)ssl
  4) Run each cell in the notebook to get the output
